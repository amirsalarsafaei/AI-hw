    "The concept of the **Digital Twin** was first introduced in 1960 during NASA's Apollo project. In this project, many simulation engines was created in the ground where sensory data from the spacecraft was sent to simulation devices. The model would then update itself with this data and send response or action commands back to the spacecraft using advanced telecommunication protocols. This concept has recently gained popularity.\n",

Additionally, there is a [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/talks/karen_willcox_how_digital_twins_could_help_us_predict_the_future?language=en) talk dedicated to this concept that you may find interesting."

    "I used manhattan distance for the heuristic function(The manhattan distance from goal).Because we move to non-diagonal neighbours (4 neighbours) the monotonicity of H(n) is trivial because we move like manhattan and every move we make if its in the direction of goal the manhattan distance lowers by one and if its not it grows by 1. we know that cost of every move is considered to be so h(n) <= h(n+1) + cost holds and because H(goal) = 0 we showed in practical questions that if a heuristic function is consistent and H(goal) = 0 we can show that its admissible as well.\n",
